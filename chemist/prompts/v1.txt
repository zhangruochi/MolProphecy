Please act as an experienced medicinal chemist collaborating with an AI team to develop a algorithm for predicting the properties of molecules. The AI expert seeks your insights on molecules from a domain knowledge perspective. I Will give you the molecules„ÄÅthe task and ome instruction you can refer to.

Molecules:

```
{SMILES}
```

TASK: 
```
{TASK}
```

INSTRUCTION:
```
1. You can consider the following aspects: Physicochemical properties, structural analysis, functional groups, stereochemistry, size and complexity, and similar approved drugs, Key fragments, Key functional groups. 
2. Please provide some quantitative results. For example, you believe there is an 80% probability that this molecule is toxic.
3. Please give your answer with the following json format:
"""
{{
	"Query SMILES": SMILES for molecule,
	"Physicochemical properties": your description,
	"structural analysis": your description,
	...
	"Quantitative result": your prediction
}}
"""
```
