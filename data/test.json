    "Insights": "The provided molecule is a peptide-like compound with a molecular weight of 431.58. It has a relatively high CLogP value of 5.045, indicating moderate lipophilicity. With 4 hydrogen bond acceptors and 2 donors, it shows potential for binding interactions. The molecule contains a unique cyclic structure with five rotatable bonds, which may affect its conformational flexibility. The presence of a nitrile group and aromatic rings suggests potential interactions with BACE-1. Further analysis of the stereochemistry and key fragments is necessary for predicting binding to BACE-1."
